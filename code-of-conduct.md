All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the Philly CocoaHeads community.

These expectations are to be considered during your participation at all group related events and gatherings. It also extends to your behavior in the community at large.

Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the group or disciplined at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.
