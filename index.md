## About Us

Philly CocoaHeads is the Philadelphia area's Mac and iOS programming group, a chapter of the worldwide [CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org/). 

CocoaHeads is a group devoted to discussion of Apple developer technologies. During monthly meetings and other events, members present on their projects and offer tutorials on various programming topics.

Our main group meetings are on the second Thursday of every month. We also hold a weekly book club and a month Side Project Saturday event. All details are available on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/PhillyCocoaHeads/).

All members are to adhere to our [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.html).

We are always looking for feedback and suggestions on what topics to discuss at our meetings. Please send email to <leadership@phillycocoa.org>.

## Sponsors

* Apple - Main Meeting venue

Philly CocoaHeads has always tried to have a very low barrier of entry for participation, thus we do not have any formal membership dues or event fees. We do however have real running costs and welcome sponsorship from local companies that benefit from our presence in the community or who are looking to reach out to Apple developers.

Monetary Sponsors helps us cover groups costs, including: meeting pizza and refreshments, online meeting software for book club, website and video archival costs, recording equipment, and more. Thank you very much. :)  

Monthly Sponsorship is offered per month for $200. Should you decide to sponsor youâ€™ll get:

* Ad placement on our webpage.
* Promotion in our meeting announcements (email/twitter/Meetup)
* An opportunity to speak at the meeting (10-15m) to plug your product or job opportunity)

Payment can be made via check or we can send you a PalPal invoice which can be paid using a credit card.
